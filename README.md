This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java. The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code that leads to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `BugSolution.java` file provides the corrected code with the loop condition fixed to prevent the error.  This example highlights the importance of carefully checking array bounds when iterating to avoid runtime exceptions.
